<h3>What is Photoshop</h3>
<p>Photoshop is an image editing software developed and manufactured by Adobe Systems Inc.
 Photoshop is considered one of the leaders in photo editing software. The software allows users to manipulate, crop, resize, and correct color on digital photos. The software is particularly popular amongst professional photographers and graphic designers.</p>
 <p>It is also a popular image editing software that provides a work environment consistent with
Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop and other products in the Adobe Creative Suite. </p>
<p>This tutorial is an introduction to using Adobe Photoshop. Here you will learn how to get started, how to use the
interface, and how to modify images with basic editing skills.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<br>
<p>
<img id="h" src="images/untitled (2).jpg" width="663" height="388">
</p>
<br>
<h4>1. Begin by opening Adobe Photoshop CS6.</h4>


<p>On a PC, click Start > Programs > Adobe > Photoshop CS6, or click on the shortcut on the desktop.</p>
<p>On a Mac, click Go > Applications > Adobe Photoshop CS6 > Photoshop CS6 shown in</p>

<h4>Setting up the document</h4>
<p>
Setting up your document correctly from the start will make your job much easier as you work through your
project. This will require some advanced planning. For example, if your final output will be a brochure, you may
need to set up your document to be horizontal and double-sided.</p>
<p>

<img src="images/untitledxdfg.jpg" width="591" height="333">
To create a new document, click <b>File > New</b>. This will open the Document Setup dialog box .</p>
<p>
Here you will be able to name your file, set up the correct page size and orientation for your document.
Options include, but are not limited to:</p>
<h4>Page Size and Orientation</h4>
<p>Change the page size by typing in new values for width and height. Page size represents the final size
you want after bleeds or trimming other marks outside the page. In the Preset dropdown menu you
can find such common sizes as letter, legal, tabloid, etc. Typing in exact values for Height and Width gives
you more control over the size and orientation of your page.</p>
<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>Resolution is the number of pixels on a printed area of an image. The higher the resolution, the more
pixels there are on the page, the better the quality of the image. However, high resolution increases
the size of the file. The standard recommended resolution for printed images is 150-300, for Web
images it is 72.</p>
<h4>Color Mode</h4>
<p>Choose a color mode that will best fit your project. For example, when making a graphic for a web
site, choose RGB. When making an image for print choose CMYK.</p>
<h4>Background Contents</h4>
<p>Choose the background: white, color or transparent. When you have entered all of your document
settings, click Ok.</p>
<h4>Opening an image from a disk</h4>
<p>If the image you have is saved on a disk or to the computer, select <b>File > Open</b>, and then navigate to the disk
drive/file where your image is saved. Choose the image file and click <b>Open</b>. At this point, you may want to save
your image under a different name so that you can always have the original to fall back on in case of a mistake.
To save your file, select <b>File > Save As</b> and type in the new name of the file in the dialogue box.</p>
<h3>2. Interface Layout</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/untitled4.jpg" width="640" height="447">.
</p>
<h4>Menu Bar</h4>
<p>If you look at the top of the screen you will see the Menu bar (Figure 3), which contains all the main
functions of Photoshop, such as <b>File, Edit, Image, Layer, Select, Filter, Analysis, 3D, View, Window, and
Help.</b></p>
<h4>Toolbar</h4>
<p>Most of the major tools are located in the Toolbar for easy access.</p>
<h4>The Image</h4>
<p>The image will appear in its own window once you open a file.</p>
<h4>Image Name</h4>
<p>The name of any image that you open will be at the top of the image window as shown above.</p>
<h4>Palettes</h4>
<p>Palettes contain functions that help you monitor and modify images. By default, palettes are stacked
together in groups. These are the palettes that are usually visible:<b> Color, Adjustments </b>and<b> Layers</b>. If none
of the palettes are visible, go to <b>Window</b> in the <b>Menu</b> bar and choose the palettes you need.</p>

<h3>3.Pallets</h3>
<p>Below is the description of the most commonly used palettes in Adobe Photoshop CS6. Palettes used for
more advanced image editing will be covered in the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Tutorial - Intermediate.</p>
<h4>Color, Swatches, Style</h4>
<p>
<b>Color</b>
<br>
The Color palette displays the current foreground and background colors and RGB values for these
colors. You can use the sliders to change the foreground and background colors in different color modes. You
can also choose a color from the spectrum of colors displayed in the color ramp at the bottom of the palette.

<b>Swatches</b>

In the Swatches palette, you can choose a foreground or background color and add a customized
color to the library.

<p>
<b>Styles</b>
<br>
The Styles palette allows you to view, select, and apply preset layer styles. By default, a preset style
replaces the current layer style. You can use the styles in the palette or add your own using the Create New
Style icon.

<h4>
History</h4>
<p>The History palette  stores and displays each action performed allowing you jump to any recent stage
of the image alteration. The alterations should be created during the current working session. After saving or
closing the document, the History palette clears all the contents. Each time you apply a change to an image, the
new state of that image is added to the palette. It is important to know that once you click on any of the previous
stages, all the changes that were made after it will be lost.</p>

<h4>Adjustments</h4>
<p>The Adjustment layers palette give you the ability to apply an effect to a group of layers in Photoshop, and then
you can edit that effect later, while preserving the original layers.</p>
<h4>

Layers</h4>
<p>Layers let you organize your work into distinct levels that can be edited and viewed as individual units. Every
Photoshop CS6 document contains at least one layer. Creating multiple layers lets you easily control how your
artwork is printed, displayed, and edited. You will use the Layers palette (Figure 9) often while creating a document,
so it is crucial to understand what it does and how to use it.</p>
<p>A) <b>Layer Visibility</b> -The eye shows that the selected layer is visible. Click on or off to see or to hide a layer.</p>
<p>B)<b> Layer Locking Options </b>-Click the checkered square icon to lock Transparency, click the brush icon to lock
the Image, click the arrow icon to lock the Position, and click the lock icon to lock all options.</p>
<p>C) <b>Layer Blending Mode</b> -Defines how the layer’s pixels blend with underlying pixels in the image. By choosing
a particular blending mode from the drop-down menu you can create a variety of special effects.</p>
<p>D) <b>Fill</b> -By typing in a value or dragging the slider you can specify the transparency.</p>
<p>E) <b>Opacity</b>-By typing in a value or dragging the slider, you can specify the transparency of the entire layer.</p>
<center><img src="images/bnm.jpg" width="217" height="262"></center>
<p>F) <b>Layer Lock</b> -The icon shows when the layer is locked and disappears when it is unlocked. Double-click the
  icon to unlock the layer.</p>
<p>G) <b>Layer Options Menu</b> -Click the black triangle to display the following options: New Layer, Duplicate Layer,
Delete Layer, Layer Properties, etc. Some of the options are presented as icons at the bottom of the Layers
palette.</p>
<p>H) <b>Link Layers </b>– Can be used to link layers together.</p>
<p>I)<b> Layer Styles</b> -If a layer has a style, an “F” icon shows at the bottom of the Layers palette. Click the little black
triangle to see style options.</p>
<p>J) <b>Layer Mask</b> -Allows you to hide certain parts of the layer, which can then be revealed by using the paintbrush
and the white paint color to expose portions of the layer.</p>
<p>K)<b> Layer Set </b>-This option helps to organize images with multiple layers. Click the icon to create a folder for
several layers.</p>
<p>L) <b>Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer</b> -Have the same opacity and blending mode options as image layers
and can be rearranged, deleted, hidden and duplicated in the same manner as image layers. Click the icon and
select an option to create a new fill or adjustment layer.</p>
<p>M) <b>Create New Layer</b> -Click this icon to create a new layer.
<p>N) <b>Delete Layer</b> -To delete a layer, select a layer in the Layers palette and drag it to the trash can icon, or
